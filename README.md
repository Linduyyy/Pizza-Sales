# Pizza-Sales

## üìåProject Overview :
This project aims to analyze pizza sales data using SQL for data exploration and KPI measurement, followed by the creation of an interactive dashboard in Excel using pivot tables. The objective is to extract actionable business insights that can help stakeholders understand performance trends and optimize sales strategies.

## üéØObjectives
- Perform KPI analysis to evaluate overall business performance.
- Identify trends in customer purchasing behavior (daily, hourly).
- Analyze performance across pizza categories and sizes.
- Visualize findings through an Excel dashboard to aid in decision-making.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
1. SQL Server Management Studio : Data querying, analysis, and KPI calculation
2. Microsoft Excel: Dashboard creation using Pivot Tables & Charts


## ‚ùìData Analysis & Findings
